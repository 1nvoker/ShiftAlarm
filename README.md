CAT ALARM!
==========

This is an Android alarm app I created for my girlfriend who has a hard time 
waking up in the mornings and wanted an app that would keep playing audio until 
she was awake enough to turn it off.

Written in C# using .NET MAUI, this app aims to create an alarm that doesnâ€™t 
stop until a math problem is solved correctly.
